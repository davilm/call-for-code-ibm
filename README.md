### Problem Definition: Climate Change

Find a solution in some aspect that today is resulting in global climate change.

The firefighter is an application to help carry out the internal management of Fire Department.

### About
Managing a Fire Department can be a complicated task, especially if it is not suitable with new technologies. The lack of efficiency in managing people and all available resources can lead to overload of professionals and damage to equipment causing an accumulation of problems.

With that in mind, we developed a super application to manage all the operations of a Fire Department, from operations against deforestation to saving the life of a cat on top of a tree.

### Features

* View List of operations in progress and completed
* Which firefighters are participating
* View Available Firefighters
* Identification of firefighters individually with photo and name
* List of animals participating in operations
* List of vehicles being used
* Location of vehicles in real time
